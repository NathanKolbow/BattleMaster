# Battlegrounds-Odds - How unlucky were you?
Sometimes it seems like there was no way you could've lost that fight, but you got crushed!  This application lets you see just what your odds really were.
```
Still very much a work in-progress
```

## Caveats
* Ghastcoiler will never be able to summon itself or Sneed's Old Shredder (this may be changed to only be able to summon either one a limited number of times in a row)
* Because the summon order of soul jugglers is impossible to know, all 3 damage juggles are sent out followed by all 6 damage juggles at any given cycle

## To-Do
* ~~Get deathrattles working~~
* ~~Test Khadgar w/ summon buffs (e.g. Mama Bear) to make sure that works as expected~~
* ~~Implement Kangor's Apprentice's deathrattle~~
* Implement deathrattles that summon minions of certain costs
